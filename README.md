todos
=====================

Create note taking applications. Applications should look like in a mockup.
![alt text](https://raw.github.com/deshaser/portfolio-ToDoAngular/master/mockup.png)

The following features should be implemented:

1. Adding a todo

2. Removing a todo

3. Mark a todo as completed

4. Show the number of todos both active and completed

5. Make filters: all todos, all completed, all active

6. Create api for saving todos state (php or nodejs, DB and data storage structure at discretion)

7. Changes made by one user should immediately be displayed to other users on the page without reloading

* whenever possible use AngularJS
